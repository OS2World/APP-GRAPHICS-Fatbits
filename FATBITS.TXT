Invocation:  START FATBITS

To install, place FATBITS.EXE in your path, FATBITS.DLL in your libpath.


Fatbits is one of those mind bogglingly useful utility programs for people
writing PM software. (If you're not a PM programmer, it'll probably bore you
to tears). It magnifies an area of the screen centered around the pointer and
paints the giant pixels into a small, tastefully decorated window. This can
be indispensable when you want to see something right down to the last pixel.

This is a re-implementation of a Mac desk accessory that's been around since
day one. This one is a little better than the Mac version since, due to the
miracle of multi-tasking, you can leave it open and still continue to use
other programs while it runs.

For those of you that care, I hereby officially release the program into
the public domain. Fatbit's been pretty thoroughly tested and I'm willing
to bet what's left of my professional reputation that it's bug free. Of
course, legally, I make no guarantees about anything it might do to your
programs, data, hardware, or sanity. Hey, you get what you pay for.

using the Task Manager. Sorry about that.
